# Release notes

## Unreleased

- Replaced `@kmamal/gpu` with the official `webgpu@0.6.0` Dawn binding for all
  Node headless rendering. `webgpu` is now a runtime dependency and supports
  current optional features including `primitive-index` and
  `texture-component-swizzle`.
- Headless adapters now forward Dawn's `wgslLanguageFeatures` instead of
  reporting an empty set. Detailed Babylon Lite GPU picking can request
  `primitive-index` and compile `@builtin(primitive_index)` shaders.
- Removed the `SHADO_DAWN_MODULE` override, `DEFAULT_DAWN_MODULE` export, and
  the `dawnModule` session options. Shado now has one supported native backend.
- Headless disposal restores the prior global `navigator`, releasing Shado's
  reference to the native GPU instance.

## 1.5.0 — 2026-08-27

Shado moved to its own public repository at
[knervous/shado](https://github.com/knervous/shado). It was developed inside a
private monorepo; nothing in `src/` or the sandbox ever imported from that
repo, so the move needed no source change — only package metadata, which now
points at the new home for `repository`, `homepage` and `bugs`.

- No API change. 1.5.0 is the first release published since 1.3.0 and carries
  everything described under 1.4.0 below, which was built but never published.
  Upgrading from 1.3.0 means reading both entries.
- Added `NOTICE.md`, shipped in the package. Shado's code stays MIT; the demo
  assets bundled for the sandbox do not fall under that grant. The humanoid
  wardrobe and supermesh sets are Ryzom derivatives under CC-BY-SA 3.0, and the
  share-alike term carries to them. Nothing about consuming the library changes
  — this matters only if you redistribute those files.
- Some sandbox demo content is not redistributable and is absent from the
  public repository: `/`, `/msdf`, `/world`, `/world-editor` and `/test` need
  asset directories that are not published. `/hum-wardrobe` and
  `/supermesh-scale` run from a clean clone, and they are the routes that
  demonstrate what the library does. The Babylon Playground example under
  `playground/` reads the same unpublished assets, so its `RAW_ROOT` must be
  repointed at a host of your own.

## 1.4.0 — 2026-08-27

Shado 1.4 adds per-module draw ownership for variant supermeshes, so a model
that ships every equipment variant as a submesh can draw only the variants its
actors actually wear.

- Added `splitMeshesIntoModules`, which regroups a variant supermesh into one
  merged mesh per group. It carries arbitrary custom vertex streams across the
  merge through `preserveAttributes` (Babylon's `MergeMeshes` rebuilds vertex
  data through `VertexData.ExtractFromMesh` and silently drops anything that is
  not one of its own vertex kinds), and repairs the winding of a reflected
  single-mesh group. Returning a constant group key collapses the split back to
  the original supermesh, which makes the migration landable in two steps.
- Added `repairSingleSourceMergeWinding` for callers that merge by hand.
  `MergeMeshes` reverses a reflected source's winding for its root mesh only
  inside the branch that resizes the index buffer for the meshes being
  appended, so a group of exactly one mesh keeps the wrong winding. It is
  invisible while a whole model merges as one supermesh and appears the moment
  a split produces a single-submesh module, reading as inside-out and unlit.
- Added `ShadoModuleDrawSet`, which gives each module its own compact actor
  list over one shared arena. It preserves the culler's ordering, suppresses
  the GPU upload for buckets that came out element-wise unchanged, switches
  empty modules off so they also leave the GPU picking pass, fans thin
  instances across every module so counts stay aligned with the arena, and
  reports `submittedVertices` / `baselineVertices` / `vertexWorkReduction`.
  Materials stay the application's: a module needs its own material because its
  index list is a per-draw binding that lives in the material's WebGPU draw
  context.
- Fixed `getVarArrayCount` under-reporting the length of every var-array whose
  float stride is even. The stride was read as `floatStride | 1`, which looks
  like a "default to 1" guard but is a bitwise OR: a `vec4` array reported 4/5
  of its real element count. The consequence is silent data loss rather than a
  wrong number, because `writeVarArrayRange` compares the write against that
  count, concludes the array is too short, and calls `resizeVarArray` - which
  shrinks `lenF` and zero-fills everything above it. Writing past 80% of a
  `vec4` array therefore wiped its tail. It reads as correct data for the first
  four fifths of the actors and zeros for the rest, so on an appearance array
  it shows up as a fraction of the crowd rendering untextured or black, with
  no error anywhere. Anyone using `arrayOf: 'vec4'` (or any other even stride)
  past 80% occupancy was affected.
- Fixed `DataTexBacking` orphaning material bindings. `bindMaterial` seeded a
  material with the buffer texture current at that moment, but growing the
  arena disposes and recreates that texture, leaving every material seeded
  earlier holding a disposed one. Babylon's `Material.isReady()` rejects a
  material whose textures are not ready, so those materials never became ready
  and never drew, with no shader error to point at. Seeded materials are now
  tracked and rebound after the texture is replaced. This affected WebGL2
  data-texture consumers only; the WebGPU storage backing has no such texture.
- Typed the module API structurally through `ShadoModuleMesh` rather than
  naming Babylon's `Mesh`. A consumer resolves `@babylonjs/core` from its own
  node_modules and TypeScript compares those class types nominally, so a
  published signature naming `Mesh` rejects the caller's own meshes whenever the
  two installs are distinct copies.
- Added `SUPERMESH_MODULE_MIGRATION.md`, a step-by-step migration guide written
  for coding agents, and `src/showcase/ShadoSupermeshModuleDemo.ts`, a runnable
  end-to-end slice that builds a wardrobe, migrates it, and reports the work
  reduction.
- Added the sandbox `/hum-wardrobe` page, which runs the pattern on a real
  43-submesh Ryzom-derived humanoid rather than a synthetic wardrobe: two
  bodies, per-piece variant and dye selection, per-actor clips and phases, and
  crowds up to 10,000. Its overlay reports actors, draw calls, populated
  modules and submitted-vs-baseline vertices together, so the claim that draw
  count is independent of instance count is checked on screen rather than
  asserted - 256 actors and 10,000 actors both draw 17 times.

Reference migration: a humanoid wardrobe of 43 submeshes and 17 variants across
7 body pieces went from 9,406 vertices skinned per drawn actor to 3,762, a
2.50x reduction in submitted vertex work with no change to the actor arena,
visibility pass, appearance array, or skeleton.

## 1.2.0 — 2026-07-30

Shado 1.2 focuses on instance-scale bandwidth, bounded residency, and measured
WebGPU execution while preserving the 1.x actor and renderer contracts.

- Added renderer-neutral actor projection streams with split transform and
  appearance storage, optional 16-byte quantized transforms, packed color,
  dirty-index synchronization, shape-aware upload plans, and adaptive direct,
  compute-scatter, or full-buffer publication.
- Added production WebGPU compute scatter to the full Babylon.js and Babylon
  Lite pipelines. Scatter batches follow changed struct spans instead of
  copying whole instance rows, share one WGSL ABI across renderers, and expose
  timestamp-query pipeline timing for benchmark validation.
- Improved high-count CPU behavior with bulk instance reservation/addition,
  structure-of-arrays visibility sidecars, compact visible-index publication,
  and worker/WASM culling paths that avoid recurring main-thread actor walks.
  Reserved sidecars now refresh after actor-arena WASM growth, preventing
  detached dirty/visibility views and partial batches near one million actors.
  WebGL2 retains the established data-texture/direct-upload fallback after the
  WebGPU optimization decision.
- Added `@knervous/shado/render-data` and `@knervous/shado/storage` package
  entry points. `DeferredStorageSlabStore` provides fixed-stride, bounded OPFS
  working-set slabs, explicit leases, predictive prefetch, sparse dirty-page
  snapshots, batched writeback, one durability sync, and direct
  `SharedArrayBuffer` mapping when cross-origin isolated.
- Added one-million live and five-million cold-backed integration gates that
  combine packed GPU transforms, cell-first WASM visibility, compact IDs, and
  a real half-float dual-quaternion VAT draw. The promoted 5M/1M-hot/8k-visible
  run sustained 60.03 FPS with 11.47 ms frame-work p95, 9.67 ms VAT GPU p95,
  and zero OPFS operations during measured frames.
- Added the OPFS cold-tier option to both sandbox renderer paths. Its 20k hot
  cap routes population overflow to quantized cold rows, reports
  visible/hot/cold/total and logical/mapped bytes independently, and provides
  an interactive five-million-actor action without allocating five million JS
  actor objects.
- Made the shared showcase controls mobile responsive with a closable bottom
  drawer, Crowd/Selected tabs, touch-sized controls, iOS-safe form fields,
  responsive renderer navigation, and mobile layouts for the world editor and
  lean-pass controls.
- Preserved the published 1.x `ShadoActor` field layout, legacy showcase
  aliases, renderer-neutral Lite boundary, no-argument include registration,
  and protected child-index behavior.
- Validated 1.2.0 with 175 Jest behavior tests and 18 Chromium integration
  scenarios, including real OPFS persistence, full/Lite shaped scatter,
  sparse projected publication, VAT compilation, 100k worker visibility, 1M
  live rendering, 5M cold backing, and mobile control behavior.

No migration is required for existing 1.x consumers. WebGPU applications can
adopt projected/scatter pipelines incrementally; WebGL2 behavior is unchanged.
OPFS remains a deferred cold tier and requires application-owned spatial
indexing and promotion policy before cold rows enter simulation or rendering.

## 1.1.0 — 2026-07-29

- Added a renderer-neutral core and adapter boundary with explicit
  `@knervous/shado/core`, `@knervous/shado/renderer`, and
  `@knervous/shado/lite` entry points. The typed renderer gate dynamically
  selects Babylon Lite or full Babylon.js without eagerly loading both
  renderer graphs.
- Added the native Babylon Lite WebGPU path, including packed storage buffers,
  shader registration, thin-instance containers, and VAT materials built only
  on public Lite APIs.
- Moved per-instance visibility, compact visible indices, dirty state, and
  culling data into structure-of-arrays sidecars. Storage-buffer and
  data-texture uploads now scale with dirty pages and visible instances without
  replacing `Mesh.render` or invoking private draw methods.
- Added the world packaging and runtime APIs: spatial compilation, compressed
  artifacts, collision acceleration data, authored regions and portals,
  lighting plans, validation, visibility reducers, worker culling, and the
  `shado pack world` CLI workflow.
- Added world authoring and runtime examples to the sandbox, including the
  region editor, streamed render chunks, object rendering, collision queries,
  lighting plans, and 10k/20k/100k visibility scenarios.
- Hardened WebGPU uploads and shaders for padded layouts, packed float values,
  visibility indirection, VAT sampling, and MSDF nameplates. Native
  thin-instance accessors now preserve decorated fields and synchronize hosted
  visibility state.
- Improved compressed runtime fetch validation and model/world preprocessing,
  including clear failures for HTML fallbacks or invalid gzip payloads.
- Preserved the 1.0 public surface while widening renderer support. Legacy
  showcase UI aliases, the protected struct index map, no-argument shader
  include registration, and the published `ShadoActor` packed layout remain
  available.
- Validated the release with 138 Jest tests, nine Chromium browser scenarios,
  declaration/API comparison against published 1.0.5, package and sandbox
  production builds, clean installs, and packed-package checks.

## 1.0.4 — 2026-07-20

- Replaced showcase shader source rewriting with typed, named
  `ShadoInstanceGLSLHooks`. Armor, weapon filtering, and custom actor material
  behavior now compose through dedicated shader strategies. The five-module
  Playground demonstrates decorated packed actor classes, published controls,
  container specialization, shader extension, application wiring, and UI. Its
  schema registrations use the decorators' callable form so Babylon
  Playground can parse them without experimental decorator support.
- Reworked the online Babylon Playground into a commented developer
  integration example with explicit scene, asset, worker, nameplate, controller,
  UI, public-command, and disposal setup. Added product-neutral
  `createShadoVatShowcase*` API aliases and kept the local sandbox on that same
  public path.
- Bridged the npm and global Babylon shader stores before showcase
  initialization. Dynamically generated actor and MSDF shaders now compile in
  Babylon Playground instead of producing repeated `src/Shaders/*.fx` 404s.
- Made instance picking follow the transformed bounds of the displayed mesh
  instead of a fixed sphere at the actor root. Canonical Babylon assets such as
  Dude and HVGirl remain targetable after large native-unit normalization.
- Fixed WebGPU validation when rendering armor-enabled VAT pools. Shado now
  activates Babylon's `DrawWrapper` instead of a raw effect and compacts atlas
  page, weapon variant, and four armor layers into one vertex metadata stream,
  keeping both four- and eight-weight rigs within WebGPU's eight-buffer floor.
- Reworked the shared sandbox/Playground overlay into two full-height panels:
  a compact Shado-first roster and a dedicated selected-instance editor. The
  editor now uses names, named animations, playback speed, position, facing,
  scale, and published controls instead of exposing packed quaternion, VAT,
  glyph, and visibility internals. Selected actors receive a pulsing 3D ring.
- Split showcase catalogs, actor/container classes, and public controller types
  out of the runtime orchestration module so the local sandbox and online
  Playground continue to consume one maintainable implementation.
- Added `@shadoPublish` metadata and the `instance.published` facade for safe,
  described public controls over packed internal fields. Friendly enum values
  can now drive numeric GPU state, including complete EQ armor families and
  right-hand socket weapon selection in the showcase.
- Replaced procedural EQ armor tints with the four material families used by
  Requiem: armorless, leather, chain, and plate. Playable-race texture arrays
  are selected per instance while preserving a single VAT-backed draw pool.
- Centered nameplates from their visible glyph bounds and assigned stable
  `ModelName N` labels to canonical Babylon Playground models.
- Corrected VAT baking for GLBs with non-identity coordinate roots: merged
  vertices are transformed once and bone palettes are converted into the same
  merged world-space basis in both browser and headless-worker bake paths.
- Added solid `baseColorFactor` material support to the atlas path so dropped
  GLBs without embedded color textures retain their authored colors.
- Restored dual-quaternion spatial blending and kept Babylon's finalized,
  matrix-indexed skinning palette. This prevents hierarchical limb distortion
  on compact rigs while retaining support for GLB coordinate-root bones.
- Multi-skin GLBs now bake the skeleton actually bound to the visible body mesh
  instead of assuming the first skeleton in the file owns every mesh.
- Made headless VAT baking preserve uniform animated bone scale. The worker now
  detects required scale (including HOM's 1.6016 palette scale), emits the
  scale texel, and rejects anisotropic rigs that rigid DQ cannot represent.
- Scale validation now uses a relative anisotropy tolerance and also runs for
  dropped GLBs. Large uniformly-scaled Blender rigs such as HVGirl (~100x) no
  longer lose scale or fail because of sub-0.01% floating-point axis drift.

- Added a shared animated-GLB drop zone to the sandbox and Babylon Playground
  overlay. Dropped files are validated, auto-scaled, animation-filtered,
  headlessly VAT-baked, and registered as normal roster pools with culling,
  shuffling, random instances, and MSDF nameplates.
- Renamed the published package and all consumer imports to the scoped npm
  package `@knervous/shado`. The `shado` CLI name is unchanged.
- Added responsive runtime VAT baking with an inline Web Worker and bundled
  scalar, SIMD128, and relaxed-SIMD AssemblyScript/WASM
  matrix-to-dual-quaternion packing kernels. Runtime validation automatically
  falls back through the compatible tiers.
- Added a fully headless Babylon `NullEngine` bake worker so GLB loading,
  skeleton sampling, and atlas packing can run concurrently without rendering
  intermediate frames or submitting commands to the visible WebGPU scene.
- Added separately-authored head geometry to the roster bake input and kept
  fantasy nameplates stable while animation clips are shuffled.
- Added a rigid-rig fast path that skips the scale-detection sampling pass and
  reduced per-frame Babylon allocations during skeleton capture.
- Added a shared Shado roster showcase for the local Vite sandbox and Babylon
  Playground, including 26 playable-race variants, four NPCs, deterministic
  fantasy names, armor tint permutations, textured terrain, and a panoramic
  procedural sky.
- Added numerical parity coverage between the WASM kernel and Babylon matrix
  decomposition for translated and compound-rotated transforms.
- Fixed padded struct-array strides in generated AssemblyScript. The showcase
  actor is 192 bytes in both the TypeScript arena and SIMD culling kernel, so
  large crowds no longer corrupt transforms/animation vectors or report a
  `NaN` visible count after baking and shuffling.
- Updated the showcase shuffle to randomize crowd position and facing as well
  as motion, lowered the plane by one world unit, and replaced the tiled path
  pattern with lower-contrast procedural moss, soil, and stone terrain.
- Corrected runtime VAT sampling to preserve Babylon's finalized skinning
  palette, the validated DQ blend, and the animation evaluation order.
  Ambient crowds now select anatomically safe
  standing/locomotion clips while retaining the broader baked action library,
  and held EQ weapon geometry is normalized to a consistent display length.

## 1.0.0 — 2026-07-18

Shado reaches its first stable major release. Version 1.0 formalizes
the packed schema/arena API and includes the Babylon rendering and asset
preprocessing work that had accumulated during the 0.x prototypes.

### Highlights

- Packed GPU structs shared by TypeScript, shader layouts, and optional
  AssemblyScript reducers.
- Data-texture and storage backing support for Babylon.js.
- DQ/VAT actor instancing with pre-baked float16 and float32 animation data.
- Lean dynamic-entity rendering with batched updates, motion, culling, sorting,
  expiration, picking, and texture atlases.
- Browser-safe loading of compressed model, VAT, shader, and WASM artifacts.
- MSDF nameplate data and rendering helpers.
- A preprocessing CLI for models, wrappers, manifests, shaders, and reducers.
- Babylon.js 9 peer support with WebGL and WebGPU sandbox coverage.
- Node 24 and Apple Silicon installs no longer pull in the unused native
  `headless-gl`/ANGLE toolchain; GPU validation runs in the Babylon browser
  sandbox where the production WebGL/WebGPU paths are available.

### Breaking changes from 0.7.x

- The canonical npm package and import specifier is `@knervous/shado`.
- Consumers should import optional features from explicit subpaths such as
  `@knervous/shado/render`, `@knervous/shado/msdf`, and
  `@knervous/shado/preprocess/runtime`.
- Treat exported binary layouts, manifest version 1, and public entry points as
  the 1.x compatibility baseline. Internal source paths remain unsupported.

The CLI executable remains `shado` for concise command lines and existing
automation compatibility.

### Sandbox audit

The sandbox covers the current feature set: Babylon.js 9, WebGL/WebGPU backend
selection, packed model loading, float16/float32 DQ VAT, optional precompiled
WASM, frustum culling, asynchronous picking, MSDF nameplates, and lean entity
rendering. Its local dependency now uses the canonical package name and
preserves the package symlink so the app and source share one Babylon instance.

### Release checklist

1. Use a supported Node LTS release.
2. Run `npm ci`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm test`, and `npm run build`.
3. Run `npm ci && npm run build` in `sandbox/`.
4. Run `npm run pack:check` and inspect the archive before publishing.
5. Publish with `npm publish` from this directory.

Declaration generation is pinned to TypeScript 5.7 because the declaration
plugin bundled by the current `tsup` release is not yet compatible with
TypeScript 7. This pin also keeps release builds working on Node 24.
